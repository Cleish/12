     <p>Tekken 7 is not like other fighting games that have only forwards and backwards movement it has 3D movement as well. You can side step by double tapping up or down. By doing this you might be able to avoid the opponents attack without losing distance. By double tapping up or down and holding the directional input you can side walk. With side walking you can avoid attacks and continue walking to get to the opponents back side. Side stepping and sidewalking is not bullet proof since some moves have "tracking" and hit side stepping opponents.</p>

      <p>Unlike other fighting games in tekken you can block without doing anything. Yes, if you don't press anything you block oncoming mid and high attacks if you hold the down button you can block low attacks and evade high attacks. Almost always if you manage to block the opponents attack the opponent loses his "turn" which means that you can attack and if they try to attack your attack will hit first. Be careful though since some attacks are strings and do many hits in a row. These strings are often bad on block so you get free hits on the opponent if you block the whole string. Some charged up attacks can't be blocked but if the opponent is using an unblockable attack you can see sparks and if you attack the opponents attack gets interrupted.</p>

     <h1>Now how about attacking?</h1>
     <p>In Tekken 7 when we talk about moves we often refer to them by their inputs like up 4 which means on ps4 controller up and circle. The buttons on the left side of the controller correspond to each limb a character has. 1 means left punch, 2 means right punch and 1+2 means both hands are used in the attack. 3 means left foot and 4 means right foot and 3+4 means both feet are used in the attack. If you want to grab to opponent you can either press 1+3 which is a normal grab or 2+4 which is a side switch grab.</p>
     <p>Tekken is regarded as the most difficult and complex fighting game franchise so it is not weird if the amount of information feels overwhelming. The most important thing is to have fun!

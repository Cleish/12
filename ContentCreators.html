      <h1>Mainmanswe</h1>
      <p>Perhaps the biggest and most well known Tekken 7 streamer and content creator Mainmanswe has been a huge Tekken fan for years. He has even played tekken 1 on the arcade and has been a huge fan ever since even going as far to go play Tekken 2 arcade beta tests. Nowadays he is a household name in the Tekken community and is loved and cherished by most of the player base. He mostly playes very technical and difficult characters lik Kazuya, Geese, Lee and Other Mishimas.</p>

      <h1>K-Wiss</h1>
      <p>One of my favourite content creators if K-Wiss. He is a professional Tekken 7 player and often he is featured as a host at Tekken 7 tournaments and other events. He has a good reputation and often does collaborations with other well known content creators or pro players. K-wiss makes almost always gameplay videos with minimal editing so it might not be appealing to everyone, but it is often very informative. K-wiss is not as well known outside the high skill Tekken players.</p>

      <h1>Arsenalty</h1>
      <p>One of the biggest creators with mainmanswe and they often make videos together. Arsenalty doesn't upload as often as most Tekken content creators like Mainmanswe and K-wiss but he puts a lot of effort into his videos. He makes a lot of edits in his videos and his videos are really well made. Arsenalty has had a lot of trouble with youtube copyright strike system and he has taken breaks because of it. Arsenalty as well as Tendo XI are known as the light-hearted Tekken 7 content creators.</p>

      <h1>Tendo XI</h1>
      <p>My favorite content creator currently is Tendo XI and he is new to the Tekken community. He grew a huge fanbase in a short amount of time with his skilled editing and versitile videos. He is always on time with the current trends and includes references to them. Tendo XI is most well known for his youtube content but he does stream too. He doesn't upload as often as other creators but it is not weird since his videos are high quality</p>

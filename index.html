     <p>Tekken 7 is one of the best selling fighting game of all time and it is selling to this day and might reach the top 3 best sellers. Tekken 7 was released on PS4, Xbox One and the PC on 2015. The game is getting quite old on todays standards where games lifespan is usually very short. Tekken 7 has gotten many updates through the years which added new content to the game but the game is still the same at the core.</p>
     <p>There has been many leaks and rumors about Tekken 8 coming out soon. Bandai Namco already announced that they wont be updating Tekken 7 anymore so it wouldn't be weird to assume that Tekken 8 would be around the corner. People are already making guesses on who will be included in the next installment of Tekken.</p>

      <p>Tekken 7 has a huge character roster that leaves no player unsatisfied. The main game has 36 characters but with expansions the player can get up to 50 characters. There is a lot of diversity with the characters as well. Tekken 7 has characters varying from robots to bears and from aliens to wrestlers. Most of the Tekken 7 cast is based on some form of martial arts like karate, taekwondo or muay thai. While having lots of characters might be good it can also be hard for new players to learn the game because there are so many characters. There are many guest characters from other games as well so you might see some familiar faces even if you are new to Tekken.</p>
